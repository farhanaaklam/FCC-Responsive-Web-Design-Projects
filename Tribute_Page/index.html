        <div id="timeline">
            <p>1907 - Born In Mexico City, Mexico</p>
            <p>1925 - On 17 September 1925, Kahlo was on her way to home from school when the wooden bus they were
                riding collided with a streetcar. The accident killed several people and fractured Kahlo's ribs, both
                her legs and her collarbone.</p>
            <p>1929 - At one of Modotti's parties in June 1928, Kahlo was introduced to Diego Rivera. Kahlo soon began a
                relationship with Rivera, who was 20 years her senior and had two common-law wives. Kahlo and Rivera
                were married in a civil ceremony at the town hall of Coyoacán on 21 August 1929.</p>
            <p>1930 - After Rivera had completed the commission in Cuernavaca in late 1930, he and Kahlo moved to San
                Francisco, where he painted murals for the Luncheon Club of the San Francisco Stock Exchange and the
                California School of Fine Arts. The couple was "feted, lionized, spoiled" by influential collectors and
                clients during their stay in the city</p>
            <p>1931 - Kahlo and Rivera returned to Mexico for the summer of 1931, and in the fall traveled to New York
                City for the opening of Rivera's retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).</p>
            <p>1934 - She was again experiencing health problems – undergoing an appendectomy, two abortions, and the
                amputation of gangrenous toes – and her marriage to Rivera had become strained. </p>
            <p>1935 - While he had been unfaithful to her before, he now embarked on an affair with her younger sister
                Cristina, which deeply hurt Kahlo's feelings. After discovering it in early 1935, she moved to an
                apartment in central Mexico City and considered divorcing him.</p>
            <p>1954 - Died at the age of 47</p>
